# FizzBuzz Using Python
This was my first attempt at a python project, using a TDD approach to building the fizzbuzz game. I used pytest as my testing framework.

I have been building on this week's goals at Makers, using the skills I have gained to be able to teach myself a new language and to build something using TDD.

## Instructions for Use
- Run the below in the command line:
```
 pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```
- Run 'pytest' in the command line to view the unit tests
- Run in the command line:
```
python fizzbuzz.py
```
- Type fizzbuzz() with a number in the parentheses to see if it will return with the number, fizz, buzz, or fizzbuzz
- With this version of fizzbuzz, it will only accept positive numbers
